# Cursor Storybook: Rapid Prototyping for Business Users

## Transform Your Business Ideas into Working Software - No Coding Required

**Cursor Storybook** is a powerful tool designed for business professionals who have a vision for an application but don't want to get bogged down in technical details. It bridges the gap between your business ideas and functional software, eliminating the endless back-and-forth cycles with designers and developers.

*Developed by [Anthus AI Solutions](https://anth.us) - experts in human-AI collaboration for business solutions.*

### For Business Users: Why This Matters to You

Traditional app development is slow and frustrating:
1. **Endless design cycles**: Weeks spent on mockups that still don't capture your vision
2. **Communication barriers**: Difficulty explaining your ideas to technical teams
3. **Long development timelines**: Months of waiting before seeing anything functional
4. **Costly changes**: Minor adjustments requiring significant rework
5. **Risk of project failure**: Discovering major issues only after significant investment

**Cursor Storybook changes everything** by allowing you to:

- **Create functional prototypes immediately** - See and interact with real components, not just static designs
- **Communicate precisely with developers** - Show exactly what you want instead of trying to explain it
- **Validate ideas quickly** - Test concepts with real users before committing resources
- **Reduce development costs** - Provide developers with working examples that clarify requirements
- **Minimize project risks** - Identify and solve problems early when changes are easy and inexpensive

## How It Works: Your Development Environment

The Cursor Storybook workflow uses two main tools:

1. **Cursor**: An AI-powered code editor where you describe what you want to build
2. **Browser**: Running three tabs:
   - **Storybook**: Shows individual components you're building
   - **Application**: Shows how everything works together
   - **Test Runner**: Verifies everything works correctly

### The Business User's Workflow

1. **Describe what you want** to the AI in Cursor
2. **See it built in real-time** in the Storybook browser tab
3. **Test it immediately** to verify it works as expected
4. **Make adjustments** by telling the AI what to change
5. **Verify nothing broke** with automated tests
6. **Repeat** with small, incremental improvements

This approach is called "vibe coding" - you focus on communicating the vibe or feel of what you want, and the AI handles the technical implementation.

## Getting Started: Setting Up Your Environment

### Step 1: Install Cursor

1. Download and install [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en) from the official website
2. Open Cursor after installation

### Step 2: Set Up Your Project

1. Clone the repository (or ask a developer to help you with this step):
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cursor-storybook
   ```

2. Install dependencies (or ask a developer to help you with this step):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Step 3: Start Your Development Environment

Open three terminal windows in Cursor (using the Terminal menu or Ctrl+` shortcut):

1. In the first terminal, start Storybook:
   ```
   npm run storybook
   ```
   This will open Storybook in your browser at http://localhost:6006

2. In the second terminal, start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000

3. In the third terminal, start the test runner:
   ```
   npm run test:ui
   ```
   This will open Majestic (the visual test runner) in your browser at http://localhost:4000

If you prefer to run tests directly from the command line instead of using the visual interface:
```
npm test
```

### Step 4: Arrange Your Windows

For the best experience, arrange your windows like this:
1. **Cursor Editor**: Where you'll describe what you want to build to the AI
2. **Browser - First Tab**: Storybook showing individual components
3. **Browser - Second Tab**: The full application showing how components work together
4. **Browser - Third Tab**: Majestic test interface showing test results

## Working with the AI Assistant

The key to success with Cursor Storybook is effectively communicating with the AI assistant. Here's how to get the best results:

### How to Talk to the AI

1. **Be specific about what you want**: "Create a contact form with fields for name, email, and message"
2. **Describe the look and feel**: "Make the submit button blue and rounded with a subtle hover effect"
3. **Explain the behavior**: "When the form is submitted, show a success message and clear the form"
4. **Reference existing components**: "Use the same card style as on the homepage"
5. **Ask for changes**: "Can you make the text larger and add more space between the fields?"

### Example Conversations

#### Creating a New Component

```
You: I need a feedback form with fields for name, email, rating (1-5 stars), and comments.

AI: I'll create a feedback form component for you. Let me set up the files...

[AI creates the component files]

You: Can you make the star rating interactive so users can click on stars?

AI: Sure, I'll update the component to include an interactive star rating...

[AI updates the component]

You: Let's add some validation to make sure the email is valid.

AI: I'll add email validation and error messages...

[AI adds validation]

You: Now let's add tests to make sure the validation works correctly.

AI: I'll create tests for the email validation...

[AI adds tests]
```

#### Modifying an Existing Component

```
You: The buttons on the dashboard are too small. Can we make them larger?

AI: I'll increase the size of the dashboard buttons...

[AI updates the component]

You: The blue color doesn't match our brand. Can we change it to #3366CC?

AI: I'll update the button color to match your brand...

[AI updates the component]

You: Let's also add an icon to the left of the text in each button.

AI: I'll add icons to the buttons...

[AI updates the component]
```

## Understanding What You're Looking At

### Storybook: Your Component Library

**Storybook** is where you see individual components in isolation. Think of it as a catalog of all the building blocks available for your application.

In Storybook, you can:
- See each component on its own
- Try different variations of a component
- Interact with components to test their behavior
- Read documentation about how to use each component

### The Application: Your Complete Product

**The Application** is the full product that combines all components together. This is what your users will eventually see.

The application shows:
- How components work together
- The complete user experience
- The actual functionality of your product

### Majestic: Your Quality Assurance Tool

**Majestic** is a visual interface for running tests. It helps ensure that everything works correctly.

With Majestic, you can:
- Run all tests with one click
- See which tests pass (green) and fail (red)
- Get detailed information about any problems
- Ensure changes don't break existing functionality

## Design Resources

When describing what you want to the AI, these resources can help you communicate more effectively:

### UI Components

Browse [Shadcn UI Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion) to see the types of components available. You can tell the AI: "Create a component like the Accordion on the Shadcn UI site."

### Colors

Reference the [Tailwind Color Palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors) when discussing colors. For example: "Use sky-500 for the button background."

### Icons

Browse the [Lucide Icon Library](https://lucide.dev/icons/) to find icons for your components. You can tell the AI: "Add a mail icon from the Lucide library to the contact button."

## Tips for Success

1. **Start small**: Begin with simple components and gradually add complexity
2. **Make incremental changes**: Small, focused changes are easier to implement and test
3. **Verify each change**: Check that each modification works before moving on
4. **Use specific terminology**: Reference component names, colors, and icons from the resources above
5. **Ask for tests**: Ensure new features work correctly by requesting tests
6. **Commit frequently**: Save your progress regularly to avoid losing work
